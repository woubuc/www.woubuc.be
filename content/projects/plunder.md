*Life at sea isn’t easy, especially when you’re a pirate. You have to beware of sea monsters, storms, the royal navy, ancient curses… But by far the most dangerous thing on the seven seas is rival pirates. They will stop at nothing to steal all your hard-earned treasures, so you shouldn’t hesitate to do the same if you get the chance.*

In august 2017 I launched a Kickstarter campaign for my first finished board game. I worked on Plunder! for nearly two years and worked together with an artist to produce artwork for the game.

The crowdfunding campaign did not succeed due to lack of marketing knowledge and experience. Nevertheless, it was an interesting journey and I have learned a lot from planning and running the campaign.
