An interactive map for the Wurm Unlimited server Sklotopolis that I used to be a member of. The map data comes from pre-generated files and is rendered in the browser.

Built with Coffeescript and vanilla Javascript, including a Node.js server application to generate the 256x256 map tiles from a 4096x4096 mapdump.
